# Hi there 🌸

## 👩‍💻 I'm Daniela Pereira and ...

🎓 I'm a recent Computer Science graduate with a strong interest in **databases**, **back-end development**, and **full-stack projects**.  
🚀 I enjoy learning and consistently put effort into exploring new technologies to improve my skills and create meaningful solutions.  
🌱 Currently focused on expanding my knowledge and skills, aiming to become a reference professional and help others along the way.  
🐾 Outside of coding, I love **animals** and enjoy relaxing by watching anime, reading, and playing video games — both challenging and more chill ones.  
🌍 I dream of traveling the world to experience diverse cultures and perspectives.
